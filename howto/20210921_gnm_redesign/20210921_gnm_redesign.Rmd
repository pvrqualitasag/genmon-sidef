# Disclaimer
A proposal for a re-design of the GenMon system is described. 


# Current Status
The current status of the GENMON system is that a PHP-Webapplication drives the following computational steps

* upload and preliminary check of pedigrees
* analysis of pedigree with PopRep
* collection of results from PopRep
* Display of results in tables and diagrams

The whole system works in principle, but it has some severe design problems. Two of the most important problems are 

* no multi-threaded analysis of pedigrees
* large pedigrees which are common in livestock populations cannot be analysed with the current system, because the PopRep analysis takes too long to complete.
