# Disclaimer


# Delete Prp Project DBs
Old PopRep databases are not deleted which causes problems in the postprocessing.

These databases are deleted with

```
# get shell in correct container
sudo singularity shell --shell /bin/bash instance://signm
```

Run the drop-db commands

```
psql -U postgres -c "SELECT datname FROM pg_database where datname like 'PPP_%';" | grep PPP | while read d;do echo " * Dropping $d ...";dropdb -U postgres $d;sleep 2;done

psql -U postgres -c "SELECT datname FROM pg_database where datname like 'PPP_%';" | grep PPP | while read d
do 
  echo " * Dropping $d ..."
  dropdb -U postgres $d
  sleep 2
done
```

Check whether old project databases are still around

```
psql -U postgres -l
#==> ok
```


The GG Pedigree is re-run.
