## Background

* Subsidies for rare breeds based on GenMon indices
* Five-year contract 
* Results usually due on Aug. 15


## GenMon Indices

* Results from PopRep based on pedigree characteristics 
    + inbreeding
    + age distribution of breeding animals
    + effective population size
    + ...
* Socio-economic factors
    + distance between animal owners
    + age of animal owners
    + ...
* Factors combined into over-all index


## Analysis Procedure

* Pedigrees requested for "external" breeds
* Pedigrees exported for breeds on Qualitas database (cattle, sheep, goat, ...)
* Prepare pedigree data
* PopRep analysis
* Add socio-economic factors
* Results in Shiny-App page


## Components of GenMon System

* Webapplication
    + URL: https://fagr.genmon.ch/gnm/genmon-ch/index.php
    + Username: see KeePassX
    + works for small breeds (not for large cattle pedigrees)
    
* Commandline
    + Hostname: fagr.genmon.ch
    + ssh-access, credentials in KeePassX

* Shiny
    + Hostname: fagr.genmon.ch
    + User: zws, credentials as other servers
    + Directory: /home/zws/ShinyApps
    + Website: https://fagr.genmon.ch/shiny/users/zws/GenMonReport2022/index.Rmd
    + How to get to results not clear


## Further Steps

* Before 28.02.2023: 
    + Ask JÃ¼rg for addresses of external breeding organisation
    + Ask Urs whether he is willing to send out requests
* After 04.04.2023: Planning of GenMon analysis 2023
* Starting after 01.05.2023: 
    + Send out requests for pedigrees at external breeding organisations
    + Start to ask EDV for pedigree exports from Qualitas Database
* June/July 2023: Run GenMon Analyses
* August 2023: Results to BLW
