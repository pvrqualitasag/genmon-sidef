## Disclaimer
This protocol contains material that helps to understand how the entries in the summary table of effective population size can be influenced.


## Background
The effective population size is computed by poprep and shown in the summary table. The content of the summary table is 

```
psql -U geome_admin -d GenMon_CH -c "SELECT * FROM summary where owner='zwsgnm';"
```

The effective population size is stored in the column `ne`. But this field can be changed on the page `breed_detail.php`. With that also all the indices are changed. 


## Effective Population Size
The effective population size (Ne) as computed by poprep is obtained by 

```
psql -U geome_admin -d GenMon_CH -c "SELECT * FROM breed11_ne;"
```

The correct statement for selecting the value of Ne

```
psql -U geome_admin -d GenMon_CH -c "SELECT Ne FROM breed13_ne where method = 'Ne_DeltaFp';"
```
