## Disclaimer
Documentation and protocol for installing PopRep.


## Download
PopRep was downloaded as shown in the download protocol in '20200528_download_poprep'. The downloaded tar-ball contains a complete linux distribution. We try to use the installation description for GenMon to find the relevant parts of PopRep.


## Installation
Based on the description in `install.html`

```
cdpgp
open GENMON_GitHub/GENMON/install.html
```


## Container
We start by building a separate container for PopRep.


### Initialise Working Directory
The container image file is built in a working directory which is created by the following script.

```
cd /home/quagadmin/simg/img/
../genmon-sidef/bash/init_simg.sh -w `pwd`/poprep
```

### Sandbox Container
For testing and debugging purposes, it is convenient to have a container sandbox directory in which we can test different solutions.

Building a sandbox container 

```
sudo singularity build --sandbox ubuntu_sand docker://ubuntu:18.04
```

Open a shell in the sandbox

```
sudo singularity shell --writable ubuntu_sand
```

### Packages 
Packages required for poprep but were installed earlier in the installation description


```
apt-get update -y
apt-get install -y vim build-essential sudo git apt-utils software-properties-common curl gdebi-core
# locales
apt-get install -y locales
locale-gen en_US.UTF-8
locale-gen de_CH.UTF-8
  
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
apt-get install -y tzdata
# set your timezone
echo 'Europe/Berlin' > /etc/timezone

# pg
apt-get install -y postgresql

```


Adding the packages needed by poprep as shown in the description. 

```
apt-get update -y
apt-get install -y texlive-full
apt-get install -y texinfo  
apt-get install -y gnuplot
#apt-get install -y pdftk
apt-get install -y zip
apt-get install -y unzip
apt-get install -y gfortran
apt-get install -y transfig
apt-get install -y xinetd
```

The package `pdftk` is not available for ubuntu bionic (18.04), it is installed via a separate procedure

```
  # special installation for pdftk which is no longer available
  curl -sSL http://launchpadlibrarian.net/337429932/libgcj-common_6.4-3ubuntu1_all.deb > libgcj-common_6.4-3ubuntu1_all.deb
  curl -sSL http://launchpadlibrarian.net/340410966/libgcj17_6.4.0-8ubuntu1_amd64.deb > libgcj17_6.4.0-8ubuntu1_amd64.deb
  curl -sSL http://launchpadlibrarian.net/277739894/pdftk_2.02-4build1_amd64.deb > pdftk_2.02-4build1_amd64.deb
  gdebi --n libgcj-common_6.4-3ubuntu1_all.deb
  gdebi --n libgcj17_6.4.0-8ubuntu1_amd64.deb
  gdebi --n pdftk_2.02-4build1_amd64.deb
  apt-get update
  rm -rf libgcj-common_6.4-3ubuntu1_all.deb libgcj17_6.4.0-8ubuntu1_amd64.deb pdftk_2.02-4build1_amd64.deb
```

Configure papersize

```
#sudo vim /etc/papersize #change the default paper size in latex
#a4 (instead of letter; + Esc + ZZ (to save))
sed -i 's/letter/a4/' /etc/papersize
paperconfig -p a4
```

Copy the PopRep code into the container. This is done via the '%files' directive in the singularity recipe file. 


### Packages for PopRep
The packages to be installed for PopRep are taken from the README.install inside of PopRep. This leads to a smaller image file.

### Check List for Installation Items
This section contains a list of requirements for running PopRep. The following items are all implemented in the singularity recipe.

* `# Install all modules needed by PopRep ==> all packages to be installed with apt-get are included in the recipe`
* `# prepare folder and copy code ==> the user 'popreport' is created in the recipe and the content of the subdirectory 'production' is moved in the recipe`
* `# install perl package -> run perl script from poprep ==> the script 'apiis-test-dependencies' is run in the recipe`
* `# prepare folder with rights for www-data user: folders 'incoming', 'projects' and 'done' are created in the recipe`

Requirements that are related to the user (zws in our case) that is running the program is implemented in the post-installation script 'post_install_prp.sh'

* `# Change permission in the /var/log/popreport.log ==> popreport.log is created under local user in post_install_prp.sh`
* `# define environment variables ==> `



## Alternative Running Mode
From 'PopRep.php' (in GENMON_GitHub/GENMON), it becomes clear that an uploaded pedigree file is processed via the command 

```
/home/popreport/production/apiis/bin/./process_uploads.sh -i /var/lib/postgresql/incoming -l /var/log/popreport.log -u www-data -g www-data -a /home/popreport/production/apiis
```

This command should be usable for a different user such as zws. The question at this point is how to start the DB-server inside of the singularity container image. The same question must be solved for the container containing TheSNPpit. This is solved in the 'post_installation'-script of TSP. 

The currently chosen setup is such that PopRep is tried to be used from user 'zws' instead of user www-data. It will also be the user 'zws' that runs the singularity container image.


## Execution Path For Pedigree Upload
The following execution path leads to the processing of uploaded pedigree data.

```{r execution_path_pedigree_upload, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = 'odg/execution_path_pedigree_upload.odg')
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/execution_path_pedigree_upload.png")
```


## Running Tests
From the web-interface of PopRep under https://popreport.fli.de/cgi-bin/entry.pl, a Sample Dataset can be downloaded and submitted. The results are returned by e-mail. This helps in verifying the results to be expected from PopRep. 

In `GenStuDb.php` the following preparation tasks (shown as `php`-code snippet) are performed before calling `PopRep.php`

```
$date=date('Y-m-d-H-i-s');
exec("mkdir /var/lib/postgresql/incoming/".$date);
exec("mv ".$_SESSION['wwwDataDirectory'].$_SESSION['fileName'].".csv /var/lib/postgresql/incoming/".$date."/datafile");
$param=array();
$param[]="email=solange.duruz@epfl.ch";
$param[]="breed=".$breed_name;
$param[]="male=M";
$param[]="female=F";
$param[]="pedfile=datafile";
$param[]="dateformat=YYYY-MM-DD";
$param[]="datesep=-";
$param[]="get_tar=0";
$j=0;
while ($j<count($param)){
	exec("echo ".$param[$j]." >> /var/lib/postgresql/incoming/".$date."/param");
	$j++;
}
```

These preparatory steps are taken from the `php-script` and are implemented in a shell-script such that 'PopRep'-jobs can be run from the commandline. The script is called `run_poprep.sh` and is included in the repository `genmon-sidef`.


## Binding PopRep Project Directories
The poprep project directories are bound when starting the singularity container. When starting the first time, we have to initialise the postrgre database.

```
BINDROOTHOST=/qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/poprep
BINDROOTCNTR=/var/lib/postresql
singularity instance start --bind $BINDROOTHOST/incoming/:$BINDROOTCNTR/incoming,$BINDROOTHOST/done:$BINDROOTCNTR/done,$BINDROOTHOST/projects:$BINDROOTCNTR/projects /home/quagadmin/simg/img/poprep/prp.simg siprp
SINGUALRITY_SHELL=/bin/bash singularity shell instance://siprp
./simg/genmon-sidef/bash/post_install_prp.sh
```

After the first installation of the database, the following command can be used

```
BINDROOTHOST=/qualstorzws01/data_projekte/projekte/poprep
BINDROOTCNTR=/var/lib/postgresql
./simg/genmon-sidef/bash/si_prp_start.sh -b $BINDROOTHOST/incoming:$BINDROOTCNTR/incoming,$BINDROOTHOST/done:$BINDROOTCNTR/done,$BINDROOTHOST/projects:$BINDROOTCNTR/projects
```

Starting a shell into the started instance

```
# SINGUALRITY_SHELL=/bin/bash singularity shell instance://siprp
sibash instance://siprp
```


## Running PopRep
The requirements of process_uploads.sh are satisfied by the following command

```
./simg/genmon-sidef/bash/run_poprep.sh -b testbreed -p test_pedigree.dat.txt -Z
```


The above command to run PopRep is modified in the following way

```
/home/popreport/production/apiis/bin/./process_uploads.sh -i /var/lib/postgresql/incoming -l /home/zws/prp/prplog/popreport.log -u zws -g zws -a /home/popreport/production/apiis
```

After changing the call to 'run_popreport_file' by prepending a dot, such the script is sourced instead of forked into a new shell, a new error pops up.

```
2020-06-23-08.45.39: processing /var/lib/postgresql/incoming/2020-06-23-08-45-29
Now running run_popreport_file ....
PATH: /home/popreport/production/apiis/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/home/popreport/production/apiis/bin 
APIIS_HOME: /home/popreport/production/apiis 
Parameter -d <DATAFILE> missing
Not enough parameters given!

Usage: run_propreport_file -b <BREED> -d <DATAFILE> -e <EMAIL>
     -m <MALE> -f <FEMALE> -y <DATEFORMAT> -s <DATESEP> -g <tar_switch>
     -I INCOMING -P <PROJECT_BASE_DIR> -D
```

This results in the error `APIIS_HOME is not set` shown in the logfile.
