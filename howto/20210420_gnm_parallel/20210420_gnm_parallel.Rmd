```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# Disclaimer
The development of a fix that allows to run multiple GenMon jobs in parallel is described.


# Problem
In 'PopRep.php' in the part after PopReport finished running, the project name is determined by the following SQL-statement

```
SELECT datname FROM pg_database where datname like 'PPP%'
```

This works only reliably, if there are not more than one project in the table `pg_database`.
