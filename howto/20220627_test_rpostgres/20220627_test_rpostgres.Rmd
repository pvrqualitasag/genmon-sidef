# Disclaimer
Test how easy it is to run post-poprep analysis with R and RPostgres


# Installation of R
First R must be installed in the container. This is done using the installation script in `qfztools`. 

```bash
cd ;cd simg
git clone https://petervonrohr@bitbucket.org/fb-zws-container/qfzcnttools.git
```

Installation of R in existing gnm-container does not work.


# Installation of RPostgres
Installation of the R-package RPostgres on the host worked and connection to the database in the container could be established.

The installation was done with the following commands

```bash
# Install Deb-Pkg
sudo apt install libpq-dev libssl-dev -y

# Installation of RPostgres
sudo su - -c "R -e 'install.packages(\"RPostgres\", repo=\"https://cran.rstudio.com\", dependencies = TRUE)'"

```

The connection test worked with

```r
# Check connection
library(DBI)
# Connect to a specific postgres database i.e. Heroku
con <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),dbname = 'PPP_xmKDvyg6exqF2', 
                 host = 'localhost', # i.e. 'ec2-54-83-201-96.compute-1.amazonaws.com'
                 port = 5434, # or any other port specified by your DBA
                 user = 'apiis_admin',
                 password = 'pass')
# send query
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables")
# show top of results
head(dbFetch(res))
# clear results
dbClearResult(res)
# disconnect
dbDisconnect(con)
```
