## Disclaimer
This contains a protocol of setting up a code repository in gogs on https://tsp-repo.thesnppit.net/gogs. 


## Why a Repository
In the current version of the GenMon container, the source code of PopReport is copied from a local tar-ball. This strategy does not port to installation on other systems. One solution to that is to import the sources into a repository. The repository is setup on the already availabel instance of gogs at https://tsp-repo.thesnppit.net/gogs.


## Creation of Repository
The repository name is always a combination of 'user/repository'. Hence, a new user called 'poprep' was created on https://tsp-repo.thesnppit.net/gogs. Under user 'poprep' a new repository called 'poprep' is initialised.
